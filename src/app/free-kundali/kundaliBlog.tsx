        <p className={styles.paragraph}>
          A Kundli is a detailed chart that represents the position of planets, the sun, and the moon at the time of one's birth. It is divided into 12 houses, each signifying different aspects of life such as wealth, health, marriage, and career. The interpretation of these positions provides a deep understanding of an individual's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and potential challenges.
