        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 mb-4">
          A birth chart is a circular diagram divided into twelve sections, each representing different areas of life known as houses. The chart maps the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets at the time of your birth, as well as the ascendant (rising sign). Each element in the chart reveals specific information about your personality and life experiences.

        <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-800 uppercase">Interpreting Your Birth Chart</h2>

        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 mb-4">
          To interpret your birth chart, you&apos;ll need to understand the significance of the planets&apos; positions in the signs and houses. Here are the steps to get started:
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>1. Identify Your Sun, Moon, and Rising Signs:</strong> These are the most influential components of your chart and provide a broad overview of your personality and life path.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>2. Examine the Planets in the Houses:</strong> Determine which house each planet is in to understand how its energy manifests in different areas of your life. For example, Mars in the 6th house might indicate a strong drive and energy in your work and daily routines.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>3. Consider Aspects Between Planets:</strong> Aspects are the angles formed between planets, indicating how they interact with each other. For example, a conjunction (0 degrees) means the planets are closely aligned and their energies blend, while a square (90 degrees) indicates tension and challenges.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>4. Synthesize the Information:</strong> Combine the meanings of the planets, signs, houses, and aspects to form a holistic interpretation of your chart. Look for patterns and themes that reveal your strengths, challenges, and potential life path.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-800 uppercase">Conclusion</h2>
