                        Vastu Shastra, the ancient Indian science of architecture, provides guidelines to create a harmonious living space that promotes health, wealth, and well-being. The bedroom, being a place of rest and rejuvenation, holds a significant place in Vastu principles. A well-designed bedroom according to Vastu can enhance sleep quality and bring tranquility to your life.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Ideal Bedroom Location</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        According to Vastu, the master bedroom should ideally be located in the southwest corner of the house. This placement is believed to bring stability and strength. For other family members, the northwest or southeast directions are considered suitable.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Bed Placement and Orientation</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        The placement and orientation of the bed are crucial for ensuring a good night&apos;s sleep. It is recommended to place the bed in the southwest corner of the room, with the head pointing towards the east or south. Avoid placing the bed under a beam, as it can create mental stress.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Furniture Arrangement</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Keep heavy furniture like wardrobes and dressers in the southwest, west, or south direction of the bedroom. Ensure that there is enough space around the bed for easy movement. Avoid placing mirrors directly opposite the bed, as it is believed to cause restlessness.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Colors for Better Sleep</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Soft and soothing colors like shades of blue, green, and lavender are recommended for the bedroom walls. These colors have a calming effect and can help improve sleep quality. Avoid using bright and bold colors, as they can create restlessness.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Lighting and Ambience</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Proper lighting is essential to create a relaxing ambience in the bedroom. Use soft, warm lights instead of harsh, bright ones. Dim lighting can help create a tranquil atmosphere conducive to sleep. Ensure that natural light enters the room during the day.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Clutter-Free Space</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        A clutter-free bedroom is essential for promoting peace and relaxation. Keep the room tidy and organized, and avoid storing unnecessary items. Clutter can create a sense of chaos and negatively impact your sleep quality.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Electronic Devices</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Minimize the use of electronic devices in the bedroom, as they can disrupt sleep patterns. If possible, avoid placing televisions, computers, and mobile phones in the bedroom. These devices emit electromagnetic radiation, which can interfere with your sleep.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Mirrors in the Bedroom</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        According to Vastu, mirrors should not be placed directly opposite the bed. It is believed that mirrors reflecting the bed can lead to restlessness and disturbances in sleep. If you must have a mirror in the bedroom, cover it with a cloth at night.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Decor and Artwork</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Choose decor and artwork that evoke a sense of calm and positivity. Avoid placing artwork that depicts violence, sorrow, or negativity. Instead, opt for images of nature, serene landscapes, or positive affirmations that promote a peaceful environment.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Plants and Indoor Greenery</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Indoor plants can enhance the Vastu of your bedroom by purifying the air and adding a touch of nature. However, avoid keeping too many plants in the bedroom, as excessive greenery can disrupt the balance of energy. Choose Vastu-approved plants like lavender, jasmine, and aloe vera.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Storage Solutions</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Effective storage solutions can help keep your bedroom organized and clutter-free. Use built-in wardrobes and under-bed storage to maximize space. Ensure that storage areas are clean and well-maintained, as cluttered spaces can create negative energy.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Windows and Ventilation</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Proper ventilation is essential for maintaining a healthy and restful environment in the bedroom. Ensure that windows are placed in the north or east direction to allow fresh air and natural light to enter the room. Avoid blocking windows with heavy curtains or furniture.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Vastu Remedies for Sleep Issues</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        If you experience sleep issues, consider implementing simple Vastu remedies to create a more restful environment. Use soothing essential oils like lavender or chamomile, play soft music, and maintain a regular sleep schedule to improve sleep quality.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Headboard and Footboard Design</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        The design of the headboard and footboard can also influence sleep quality. A solid, sturdy headboard provides support and stability, while an open or lightweight footboard can promote positive energy flow. Avoid metal headboards, as they can disrupt energy balance.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Flooring and Rugs</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Choose flooring materials that are comfortable and easy to maintain. Wooden flooring is considered ideal for the bedroom, as it creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. Use soft, plush rugs to add comfort and enhance the overall Vastu of the room.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
