            <h2 className={styles.h2}>The Role of Astrology in Financial Planning</h2>
            <p className={styles.p}>
              Astrology provides a unique perspective on financial planning by analyzing the positions of planets like Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus, which are traditionally associated with wealth and prosperity. By studying these planetary positions in your birth chart, astrologers can offer guidance on when to invest, save, or even start new financial ventures.

            <h2 className={styles.h2}>Best Times to Invest</h2>
            <p className={styles.p}>
              Certain astrological periods are considered auspicious for investments. For instance, a strong Jupiter transit can indicate a favorable time for long-term investments, while Venus can signal good periods for short-term gains. It&apos;s essential to consult an astrologer to understand how these transits align with your personal birth chart.
            </p>
  
            <h2 className={styles.h2}>Optimal Periods for Saving</h2>
            <p className={styles.p}>
              Saving money is crucial for financial stability, and astrology can help you determine the best times to focus on building your savings. Saturn, known for its influence on discipline and long-term planning, can highlight periods where saving and prudent financial management will be most effective.

              In addition to timing, astrology offers remedies to enhance financial stability. These may include wearing specific gemstones, performing rituals, or chanting mantras dedicated to planets that influence wealth. These practices aim to harmonize planetary energies and attract prosperity.
