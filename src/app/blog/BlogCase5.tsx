          Love is a beautiful yet complex emotion that can bring immense joy and sometimes heartache. While some people dive headfirst into romance, others approach it with caution or even fear. Astrology can offer insights into why certain zodiac signs might be more hesitant to fall in love. Here are four zodiac signs that often find themselves wary of love&apos;s unpredictable journey.

They worry about getting hurt or not meeting their partner&apos;s expectations. This meticulous earth sign prefers to take their time, analyzing and ensuring that a relationship is worth the emotional investment before they fully commit.
