                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Practical Applications of Astrology</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        By understanding your zodiac sign and its associated traits, you can make more informed decisions in various aspects of life, including career, relationships, and personal growth. Astrology offers a framework to understand yourself and others better, fostering empathy and self-awareness.
                    </p>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        For instance, knowing that Aries individuals thrive on challenges and competition can help them choose careers that offer dynamic and competitive environments. Similarly, understanding that Taurus individuals value stability and comfort can guide them towards roles that provide security and long-term growth.
                    </p>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        In relationships, understanding the compatibility between different zodiac signs can help in building harmonious and fulfilling connections. For example, fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) often get along well with air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) due to their complementary qualities.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>The Influence of Planetary Transits</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Planetary transits play a significant role in astrology, influencing our lives as planets move through different signs and houses. These transits can trigger events, bring opportunities, or highlight areas that need attention.
                    </p>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        For example, when Jupiter transits through a person&apos;s career house, it can bring growth and expansion in their professional life. Similarly, a Saturn return, which occurs approximately every 29 years, often marks a period of significant personal growth and reevaluation.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Astrology and Personal Growth</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Embracing astrology can guide you in navigating life&apos;s challenges and opportunities. By aligning with the cosmic energies, you can unlock your full potential and lead a more fulfilling life.
                    </p>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        For instance, understanding the lessons and challenges associated with your Saturn return can help you make conscious choices and embrace the growth opportunities it presents. Similarly, being aware of your lunar cycles can help you harness the power of the Moon for emotional balance and well-being.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Astrology offers a profound understanding of how the stars influence our lives.
