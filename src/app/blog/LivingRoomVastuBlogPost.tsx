                        The living room is one of the most important spaces in any home. It is where family members gather, guests are entertained, and daily activities take place. According to Vastu Shastra, the ancient Indian science of architecture, arranging your living room in accordance with Vastu principles can promote peace, positivity, and prosperity in your home.

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Ideal Location for the Living Room</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        The best location for the living room is the northeast or northwest direction of the house. These directions are believed to attract positive energy and create a welcoming atmosphere for guests.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Furniture Arrangement</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Arrange the furniture in a way that promotes easy movement and conversation. The seating arrangement should ideally be in the shape of a square or rectangle. Avoid placing the furniture against the walls as it can obstruct the flow of energy.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Colors and Decor</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Use light and soothing colors for the walls and decor. Shades of white, cream, light yellow, and green are considered ideal for the living room as they promote calmness and positivity. Avoid using dark colors as they can create a heavy and oppressive atmosphere.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Lighting</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Proper lighting is essential for creating a harmonious living room. Use a combination of natural and artificial lighting to ensure the room is well-lit. Avoid using harsh lights; instead, opt for soft and warm lighting to create a cozy and inviting ambiance.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Decorative Elements</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Decorate the living room with elements that enhance positivity and energy flow. Place a water fountain or an aquarium in the northeast direction to attract wealth and prosperity. Use indoor plants to purify the air and add a touch of nature to the space.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Placement of Electronics</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Place electronic devices like the television, music system, and air conditioner in the southeast direction of the living room. This placement is believed to minimize the negative impact of electronic devices on the energy balance of the room.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Clutter-Free Space</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Keep the living room neat and clutter-free to maintain a positive and harmonious environment. Avoid overcrowding the space with too much furniture or decorative items. Ensure that the room is well-organized and free from unnecessary items.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Mirrors and Artworks</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
                        Use mirrors and artworks to enhance the beauty and energy of the living room. Place mirrors in a way that they reflect positive images and light. Choose artworks that depict happy and positive scenes, avoiding those that portray violence or sadness.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className={styles.h2}>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p className={styles.p}>
